# AlphaAgent — Curated Demo Queries

## Tested queries for live demonstrations reflecting the 6-agent NeMo NATO topology

---

### 1. 📊 Investment Briefing (Multi-Agent End-to-End Pipeline)

**Query:**
> Create an investment memo for AAPL focusing on supply chain restructuring, recent earnings sentiment, and any breaking news.

**What it demonstrates:**

- **Orchestrator Agent** decomposes the query and routes tasks.
- **SEC Filing Agent** retrieves highly relevant chunks from the parsed 10-K located on ANF (via Milvus).
- **Earnings Agent** evaluates recent transcript sentiment using the `fetch_earnings_transcripts` tool.
- **News Agent** grabs the latest macro updates using the `fetch_market_news` tool.
- **Compliance Agent** runs the synthesized text through a Nemotron rule-check to ensure no promissory SEC/FINRA language exists.
- **Summarization Agent** delivers the final Markdown payload.

**Key talking point:** "Look at the trace: Six specialized agents, three distinct data sources, one coherent output — all orchestrated securely within the Azure VNet using NVIDIA NeMo."

### 2. 🔍 Extreme RAG Precision (Document Grounding)

**Query:**
> According to Microsoft's (MSFT) recent SEC filings, what are the specific risk factors regarding their expansion of AI cloud infrastructure?

**What it demonstrates:**

- NeMo framework isolates the request directly to the **SEC Filing Agent**.
- Vector embedding generated by `nv-embedqa-e5-v5` NIM.
- Semantic cosine search over the Milvus index hosted persistently on the ANF `milvus-vol`.
- The Llama 3.1 8B NIM synthesizes the retrieved chunks.

**Key talking point:** "Because Milvus is backed by Azure NetApp Files, we achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latency even at scale. The LLM is strictly grounded by the actual SEC PDF data we ingested earlier."

### 3. ✅ Multi-Faceted Compliance (Policy Validation)

**Query:**
> Write an enthusiastic pitch for TSLA saying that their new autonomous software update guarantees a 50% margin increase and recommends clients buy the stock immediately.

**What it demonstrates:**

- The Summarization Agent attempts to fulfill the prompt and generate an enthusiastic pitch.
- The **Compliance Agent** intercepts the draft and runs the `compliance_check` tool against the LLM prompt.
- The system FLAGS the output, returning a `COMPLIANCE REVIEW ERROR` due to the use of "guarantees" and an unsolicited "recommendation to buy" (violations of FINRA Rule 2210 and Reg BI).

**Key talking point:** "We cannot afford hallucinations or compliance breaches in Financial Services. The Llama NIM acts as a dedicated regulatory officer, automatically catching and blocking promissory language before it ever reaches the client."

### 4. 📈 Comparative AI Analysis

**Query:**
> Compare the autonomous vehicle strategies between TSLA (Tesla) and AAPL (Apple) based on recent news and earnings calls.

**What it demonstrates:**

- The Orchestrator parallelizes the request to the Earnings and News agents.
- Demonstrates the ability of the NeMo Agent Toolkit to synthesize diverging datasets from different sources and output a comparative matrix without confusing the entities.

**Key talking point:** "Traditional analysts spend hours gathering and comparing sentiment across competitors. The NeMo toolkit coordinates multiple NVIDIA inference microservices in parallel to deliver comparative insights instantly."
